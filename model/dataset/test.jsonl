It's very helpful for me, though, for your treatment later on. But I realize it's not the traditional understanding that most clients have of counseling, just supplying data to the counselor all the time. We will get to the, I guess you could say, quote, unquote, real sessions when we start next time. But I want to thank you for being patient through this process. It really will help us to get more valuable you to get more value out of those sessions. And I want to encourage you. I know that from what you said in the intake that you're feeling down. You don't feel like you're relating well to your co workers. It appears that you're disappointing yourself in how you're relating to your children and your husband. Not a good mom, not a good spouse. All these thoughts are understandable in the context of being down or maybe depressed, if that's what's going on. It sounds like that is what could be going on. But we'll figure it out as we move through and work toward a diagnosis. But as you commit to therapy and as you come in for counseling regularly, it would be my hope that these symptoms would improve. And oftentimes they do. Obviously, I can't guarantee it, but oftentimes they do. So I want you to recognize that it's a value to be hopeful and to look forward to good things and to realize you've taken a big step by coming here today. And it was difficult. I know it wasn't easy by answering all these questions, rehashing all these things, and the work of counseling itself is challenging at times, but I do think it's worth it if it has a good chance, and it does, of improving how you feel. So I want to applaud your commitment to that and encourage you to attend the first session and attend every session and really work through this process.

Then what are your measures of success?\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Restatement\nClient: That's such a good question. And I thought about that a lot. Yet I don't know if I have a concise answer, but I'll do my best. Which is I think being successful is having the freedom to do what you want to do and have it feel like it's the thing that you should be doing. So I don't just do this because I get paid for it. I do this because I enjoy being on this side of the camera and I do this because I enjoy reaching everybody else on the other side of the camera. I also enjoy that we're talking about mental health and not what Halloween candy is going to be big this year, which to me isn't as big of a deal. I love that what we're doing is impactful and influential. And I think if people can find themselves in a scenario like that where they're doing what they want to do, they have the freedom to do it. And it feels like what they should be doing. Because I would want to also run a sushi restaurant, but I don't think that's what I should be doing. So this also feels like what I should be doing. So I think when you have both of those together is successful. And so I don't think money is an indicator of success by itself, but we obviously use money as an indication of how well a company does or what kind of lifestyle you can provide or whatever.

The thing I love most out of any relationship is the ability to be honest and transparent without fear of getting lashed at. Because I'm always honest and transparent, even if the consequence is aversive. And I want that quality in my partner. I want them to be honest. I never want to guess what you're thinking. I want to never. I don't want to be like, oh, no, I'm fine. If you go out, don't worry, I'll just stay here by myself. And I go, you're clearly lying. You know, I don't like to play that game. And then someone who is independent, I don't want to complete somebody. I don't want to make somebody happy. I want them to be happy and complete as they are. Just as I feel I'm happy, complete as I am. And I'm not looking for anybody to complete me. I'm just looking for someone to enjoy life with.\nClient Emotion: depression\nTherapist: Okay. All right.

Listen, more days than not, the only thing a partner and two partners might talk about is who's taking the car this morning and did you remember to get the milk? You know, not every day is a big ticket day in a relationship, but when those big ticket days happen, those are the bridges that carry the relationship to the next level. And that's where narcissistic people can't go. So while I'm not seeing those patterns for you, I do think practice it, because being there for another person emotionally is a practice skill. And in our technologically soaked world, people are not good at being there for other people. They're so distracted. They're like, fondling their phones, put it away. Look at that person, be present with them. Stop doing your grocery list in your mind and be in the room.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Structuring the therapy\nClient: Yes.

And if you notice this pattern in someone else who can't be with your emotional space at all, then that's also a red flag for you. But, like, listen, you know, I'm not. You don't seem like Mr. Narcissism, given that you're in this industry. You live in la, you're young, all the things that kind of are the flame under that pot kind of thing. It doesn't seem to be happening. You have a holistic, healthy sense of yourself. Remember, you have a solid sense of yourself.

I was switching meds. I went from Prozac to something else that didn't work, and I went into something else. And there were gaps in. There was that I wasn't on meds at all.

It really will help us to get more valuable you to get more value out of those sessions. And I want to encourage you. I know that from what you said in the intake that you're feeling down. You don't feel like you're relating well to your co workers. It appears that you're disappointing yourself in how you're relating to your children and your husband. Not a good mom, not a good spouse. All these thoughts are understandable in the context of being down or maybe depressed, if that's what's going on. It sounds like that is what could be going on.

I know it wasn't easy by answering all these questions, rehashing all these things, and the work of counseling itself is challenging at times, but I do think it's worth it if it has a good chance, and it does, of improving how you feel.

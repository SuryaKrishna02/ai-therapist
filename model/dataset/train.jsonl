Having any negative thoughts about your life in light of the fact that people have it so much worse. Right. This kind of. It says it's a very, it's a very stoic kind of, who the heck am I to complain when people have it so much worse? Where. And I have to say when I hear that, it always concerns me because at some level I often think to myself, like, ah, this person is going to be perceived as so strong by everyone. Like, you're right, what do you have to complain about? Right? But I have to tell you, I once read this book by a woman named Dr. Edith Eager and she did such a beautiful job. She really sort of, she's sort of the, like a very female parallel voice to Viktor Frankl. And in her book, it's called the Gift, she writes about this idea of. So often we feel like we either don't get to be in, we don't get to complain about our lot in life because some people have it worse, or she gave a great example of a person getting aggravated at someone, like a therapist getting aggravated at someone for complaining, thinking, how could you be complaining about this? Like, you know, thinking like as a therapist two hours before I might have been hearing someone who has a much worse problem. Right. But what Dr. Eaker says is that the therapist has to be masterful at being able to, at being able to understand that everyone's crisis is their crisis from a subjective point of view. For one person, not being able to get to their nail salon when it could open felt tragic to them. For another person processing the suicide of their child. And you're like, can these be these two things be compared? And Dr. Eager would say yes, because in both cases that person had a negative mood experience and we don't get to judge it. And I have to say her writing has been quite influential for me and again builds on Dr. Frankl's work as well. So it's this idea that we don't get to judge, not as therapists, nor do we get to judge ourselves as individuals. Your pain is your pain. And so that theme really struck me hard about you. And then I wanted to get to the core of where that came from. And that's where your history came in. And I do know you're gay and I knew that very much. So that people who have statuses, who maintain, who hold roles, I should say role statuses that are marginalized by society are often the ones who judge themselves most harshly because society already does that for you. That societal judgment almost passively gets internalized and as a result, people who live within marginalized roles and statuses are more likely to self pathologize than other groups."}

I probably have some stupid questions, but. Bridget, are there any questions I can ask about this? I'm too emotional right now.", "output": "Client Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Open questions\nTherapist Emotion: sadness\nTherapist: Kyle, first of all, thank you. I'm glad we were able to do something that would teach people. Let me tell you though, part of what I think we were able to do here that I hope and wish more people would get in therapy, that's that idea of understanding those internalized societal messages. I think that too often therapy doesn't integrate that. We're so focused on the closed system of the individual that we don't weigh in on what structural, systemic issues do to a person and how that can actually be a major driver to our mental health. One of the biggest problems to me in psychotherapy is the unwillingness to consider all of that, the outsideness of it all. Listen, I practice in Los Angeles and a significant proportion of people bring at least one kind of marginalized status, whether I guess a gender, race, ethnicity, whatever. And it's not like I'm saying that that's the sole explanatory mechanism, but it really does help sometimes understand that volley between in and out. And I think a lot of people don't think of it that way. And why a lot of people don't is they're almost afraid of feeling like they're blaming the world for their problems or they're putting themselves in a victimized stance. And at no point were you doing that. If anything, you were really almost self shaming, self harming and self gaslighting. And so it's to sort of break you out of that cycle. Because for me, the win with you would be for you to give permission to yourself to be able to be okay with not being okay, so that you'd be get. You'd get back to okay. A lot more quickly that this idea that my feeling sad and my feeling tired doesn't get to happen because someone else lost a child or lost their job is. It's, it's a, it's comparing to. It's like comparing. It's not even apples and oranges. It's like hammers and cows. Like there's literally no, like they're not even fruit. Like they're not even common. And so, and I think that one of the problems is, is that we have this sort of intersubjectivity. Like I can only judge my experience on the basis of someone else's experience. We humans do that. We're a tribal species, right. We tend to look outside of us. But it's also being able to know that no more and no more than I judge myself. For example, let's say it's a warm day and I feel cold. It's tempting to say, oh gosh, there's something wrong with me, I'm cold, I'm cold. We tend to be more comfortable doing it with physical states. I'm cold, I'm hungry, that sort of stuff. We don't judge, but when it comes to our emotions, we judge. And that's, that's what I would love for, if we had worked together, what we would keep working on. So, you know, a few takeaways, Kyle, would be, you know, number one is pay attention to how you talk to yourself, right?

{"instruction": "You are a compassionate and skilled therapist with tons of experience.\nUsing past conversations context, for each client input: \n(1) Identify the client's emotion; \n(2) Reflect on your emotion as the therapist; \n(3) Determine a therapeutic strategy\n(4) Provide a compassionate and helpful response.\n", "input": "Past Conversation Context:\nTherapist: You told me how you're feeling. You told me how you've been feeling like this for a long time. You gave me a glimpse into your mental health history and your physical health history and how they kind of come together. You let me know that you obviously had solicitous parents who encouraged therapy, but then you really were able to pivot into the space of being able to talk about the guilt and then ultimately the shame you felt about having. Having any negative thoughts about your life in light of the fact that people have it so much worse. Right. This kind of. It says it's a very, it's a very stoic kind of, who the heck am I to complain when people have it so much worse? Where. And I have to say when I hear that, it always concerns me because at some level I often think to myself, like, ah, this person is going to be perceived as so strong by everyone. Like, you're right, what do you have to complain about? Right? But I have to tell you, I once read this book by a woman named Dr. Edith Eager and she did such a beautiful job. She really sort of, she's sort of the, like a very female parallel voice to Viktor Frankl. And in her book, it's called the Gift, she writes about this idea of. So often we feel like we either don't get to be in, we don't get to complain about our lot in life because some people have it worse, or she gave a great example of a person getting aggravated at someone, like a therapist getting aggravated at someone for complaining, thinking, how could you be complaining about this? Like, you know, thinking like as a therapist two hours before I might have been hearing someone who has a much worse problem. Right. But what Dr. Eaker says is that the therapist has to be masterful at being able to, at being able to understand that everyone's crisis is their crisis from a subjective point of view. For one person, not being able to get to their nail salon when it could open felt tragic to them. For another person processing the suicide of their child. And you're like, can these be these two things be compared? And Dr. Eager would say yes, because in both cases that person had a negative mood experience and we don't get to judge it. And I have to say her writing has been quite influential for me and again builds on Dr. Frankl's work as well. So it's this idea that we don't get to judge, not as therapists, nor do we get to judge ourselves as individuals. Your pain is your pain. And so that theme really struck me hard about you. And then I wanted to get to the core of where that came from. And that's where your history came in. And I do know you're gay and I knew that very much. So that people who have statuses, who maintain, who hold roles, I should say role statuses that are marginalized by society are often the ones who judge themselves most harshly because society already does that for you. That societal judgment almost passively gets internalized and as a result, people who live within marginalized roles and statuses are more likely to self pathologize than other groups.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Self-disclosure\nClient: Yeah, look you really nailed it. You really nailed it. When you tied it all together at the end, I felt all of it being tied together in my brain. That's how in line it was with what was going on in my head. What you were saying, which really made me feel heard, I think that was my reaction was not just the realization of where these feelings are coming from, but also, oh my gosh, this woman in 10 minutes understood what I was talking about. I've been to a lot of therapy, Dr. Ramani, and those moments that I just had with you, truly in 15 minutes. I mean, I don't have a lot. I don't have those every therapy session. You know what I mean?\nClient Emotion: joy\nTherapist: That's good.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Restatement\nClient: It's a build. I don't have any good questions. I probably have some stupid questions, but. Bridget, are there any questions I can ask about this? I'm too emotional right now.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Kyle, first of all, thank you. I'm glad we were able to do something that would teach people. Let me tell you though, part of what I think we were able to do here that I hope and wish more people would get in therapy, that's that idea of understanding those internalized societal messages. I think that too often therapy doesn't integrate that. We're so focused on the closed system of the individual that we don't weigh in on what structural, systemic issues do to a person and how that can actually be a major driver to our mental health. One of the biggest problems to me in psychotherapy is the unwillingness to consider all of that, the outsideness of it all. Listen, I practice in Los Angeles and a significant proportion of people bring at least one kind of marginalized status, whether I guess a gender, race, ethnicity, whatever. And it's not like I'm saying that that's the sole explanatory mechanism, but it really does help sometimes understand that volley between in and out. And I think a lot of people don't think of it that way. And why a lot of people don't is they're almost afraid of feeling like they're blaming the world for their problems or they're putting themselves in a victimized stance. And at no point were you doing that. If anything, you were really almost self shaming, self harming and self gaslighting. And so it's to sort of break you out of that cycle. Because for me, the win with you would be for you to give permission to yourself to be able to be okay with not being okay, so that you'd be get. You'd get back to okay. A lot more quickly that this idea that my feeling sad and my feeling tired doesn't get to happen because someone else lost a child or lost their job is. It's, it's a, it's comparing to. It's like comparing. It's not even apples and oranges. It's like hammers and cows. Like there's literally no, like they're not even fruit. Like they're not even common. And so, and I think that one of the problems is, is that we have this sort of intersubjectivity. Like I can only judge my experience on the basis of someone else's experience. We humans do that. We're a tribal species, right. We tend to look outside of us. But it's also being able to know that no more and no more than I judge myself. For example, let's say it's a warm day and I feel cold. It's tempting to say, oh gosh, there's something wrong with me, I'm cold, I'm cold. We tend to be more comfortable doing it with physical states. I'm cold, I'm hungry, that sort of stuff. We don't judge, but when it comes to our emotions, we judge. And that's, that's what I would love for, if we had worked together, what we would keep working on. So, you know, a few takeaways, Kyle, would be, you know, number one is pay attention to how you talk to yourself, right? So if someone was talking to you the way you were talking to yourself, you'd be like, hey, like hello, you need to step back because this isn't.\nTherapist Emotion: sadness\nTherapeutic Strategy: Open questions\nClient: Okay, except way meaner.", "output": "Client Emotion: anger\nTherapeutic Strategy: Self-disclosure\nTherapist Emotion: anger\nTherapist: But yeah, yeah, most of us accept from ourselves far, far worse than we would ever expect from someone else. So part of this becomes mindful self monitoring of your own self talk, which is never easy to do because the self talk is such a passive experience that's internal to us, right? So I'd love for you to spend more time being more mindful and aware on how you talk to yourself. Number two, I'd love for you to do almost like a one or two week experiment where you honor your moods and be with them. So when your body is telling you you're tired, instead of saying, oh my God, Kyle, what's wrong with you? So many people have it worse. Say, I'm going to honor, almost like talk to your body. Maybe not do it in front of other people, but honor your body and say, you tired, let's go rest and go and take care of you, right? Instead of yelling at you, take care of you. So you're tired, let's go, let's go take rest. Because I think after a while, once your body and your psyche connect and feel confident like our host has got us, like, we will be okay. We know we're going to be taken care of together, you might actually feel better. Does that make sense? Like, if I know I'm going to someone's house and they're going to be like, you want to take some rest, you want to take a shower, you want something to eat? I feel taken care of. But if they're like, you're going to do everything on my agenda and I'm going to wake you up at 4 in the morning and then I'm going to make you go to bed at 10. We're going to only talk about what I want, eat what I want. I'll be like, I don't want to be here. Right. And I'd feel tense and upset. Well, I want you to be a better host. And so I want you to just sort of work on some of that very simple self compassion, listening to yourself. Because I'm hearing you won't take advantage of that. Like, you won't say, okay, I'm going to stay in bed for two weeks. I think you'll say, I got my rest, I'm good. And you know that you'll honor your need for rest when you may need it at a later, you know, at a later time. Those would be two things that I'd really want you to work on again. Especially that mindfulness, Staying in the moment, being with your feelings and not judging them. And as a third enhancement, you may want to consider journaling. Journaling can take a lot of forms. And sometimes people like, I am not writing Dear Diary every day, and I'm not telling you to do that. Sometimes it's as simple. I tell some of my clients, you don't feel like journaling every day. Give yourself a little rating. I actually have an app, and it goes off at whatever time it goes off. And I can actually rate my. I can rate my moods, if that makes sense. Right. I can rate my, you know, like, did I have a good day? Did I have a bad day? Am I tired? Am I sad, Am I this, am I that? So it gives me a chance to just sort of like touch base. And over time I get data. I can look at that data over time and say, oh, wow, that was a bad week, or this is a better week, or what was it about that day that was better or worse? So keeping that kind either through a mood tracking app or jotting a few things down. Watching the ebbs and the flows of time? That can help too."}

I don't want to cry on this thing. Number one by a lot, like a long shot. And naturally, as my brother and father also were grieving this, they probably bonded together. I very quickly went off to college anyway, so I was separated. So I think it was a combination of. I think it was a combination of my mom going, me moving off to college and being by myself. And then I also just think there are natural differences with me being gay and my father and brother being straight. We live in two different worlds.

And when I really start to think about that, well, it makes me sad. Makes me. Yeah, it makes me sad. And it makes me also feel like, why am I not. What do I need to do? Who do I need to be in order to have those types of bonds that I see other members in my family have? And it's. It's kind of embarrassing to say all this at 35 years old because I feel like a little kid who's like, I want attention from my family. But it's kind of true. I want attention from my family, you know, and it was always manageable, and it still is manageable, but it's harder to manage now because I just moved back home. So I see it all. It's closer to me. I'm less removed from it. I'm in the middle of it, and I get to see everybody more, but I also get to see those relationships that they're having with each other more. Does that make sense?\nClient Emotion: sad\nClient Emotion Analysis: The speaker appears to be in a positive emotional state, as evidenced by his smiling expression and relaxed posture. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as feeling happy, satisfied, or content. It is difficult to determine the exact cause of the speaker's positive emotional expression without additional context or information.\nTherapist: Yeah, it does. Let me ask you, when you think these thoughts or beliefs first emerged, do you remember the first time you started thinking, well, maybe they're closer or somehow I feel less than. When did you first recognize that?\nTherapist Emotion: disgust\nTherapeutic Strategy: Structuring the therapy\nClient: I know exactly when it was. It was when my mom died when I was 16. My brother was 13. And at that, my first 13 years of my life, it was me and my mom. Oh, my gosh. I mean, everywhere. Everything, Me and my mom, I recognized my dad and brother were part of the family. But in my head, it was. It was me and my mom. And so when I lost her, I understand my dad lost his wife, and my brother also lost his mother, but I lost the number one person in my life. Number one. I mean, number one by. I don't want to cry on this thing. Number one by a lot, like a long shot. And naturally, as my brother and father also were grieving this, they probably bonded together. I very quickly went off to college anyway, so I was separated. So I think it was a combination of. I think it was a combination of my mom going, me moving off to college and being by myself. And then I also just think there are natural differences with me being gay and my father and brother being straight. We live in two different worlds. Not completely, but in certain areas, my experience in this world is very different from theirs, specifically because I'm gay. And so that, you know, it takes a little more effort on both of our ends in order to kind of build that bridge.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Thank you so much for sharing that.

And it's really hard to separate yourself from a thought once you're fused with it. And in acceptance, income and therapy we talk about these techniques called diffusion where essentially you are actively trying to diffuse the bomb in a way. Diffuse the bomb because thoughts can be very devastating, as we talked about, very destructive, but also unfuse yourself from the thought, separating yourself from the thought, knowing that you are a separate entity and that the thought is just a mental event that you as a person of agency is having. And that can be very empowering and can also help so that there aren't this cascade of negative thoughts that follow along with the emotional reactions and the self sabotaging, self defeating actions that you actually just gave a good example of.

And I'm not worthy enough to be in this family. As you can think about that thought right now, how does that feel? If that actually represented what was truly going on? I mean, how does that feel to you emotionally and viscerally right now at this moment?\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts\nClient: Overwhelmingly devastating. I mean, even saying it out loud feels so violent. It feels like a knife going into my stomach. It feels. It feels like somebody I cared about insulted me. When I say what I just said out loud, I mean, it feels devastating. Devastating is the best word I can come up with.\nClient Emotion: sadness\nClient Emotion Analysis: The speaker appears to be in a state of sadness or disappointment. His facial expression and posture suggest that he may be experiencing some form of emotional distress or frustration. It is possible that the speaker is dealing with a personal issue or a difficult situation in his life.\nTherapist: Absolutely. It goes to your core beliefs about who you are. And if you feel that you are not worthy to be within your own family, well, it's kind of a common idea that our family should be the most accepting. And so if you're not worthy enough to be part of your family, then who are you essentially worthy to be a part of in terms of the rest of the world? And that, of course, is devastating. So I really appreciate you sharing that. But of course, as we've talked about, thoughts are not necessarily facts, but they feel so real when you say it like that. And you can see the emotional devastation one can feel when they really lock into that thought and entertain it for any period of time. What I would like us to do is really a couple of challenges that will help us to loosen this thought. Because sometimes we become so fixated on the thought, we fuse with our thought. In acceptance and commitment therapy, we talk about fusion like you fuse your identity and who you are with the thoughts that you're having as if they're one and the same. So somebody could have a thought, I'm a loser. It's a thought, it's a mental event. But if you fuse with that idea, well, what's going to happen? You're going to have all kinds of negative self defeating thoughts that cascade from that along with negative emotional reactions and also self sabotaging actions where, well, if I'm a loser, then why even bother applying for this job? Not going to get it right. So you preclude yourself from the opportunities of having better outcomes. You don't even essentially test out those hypotheses anymore.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Others\nClient: And you know what? That happened to me in May of this year. I was in a really bad spot. And part of my rumination was where I fit in with my family. And I even had conversations with some friends when I was really at a low point where I go, I don't even want to reach out to them anymore. I don't want to have to go over there. I'm going to remove myself. And it's exactly what you just said is what I was doing.\nClient Emotion: depression\nTherapist: Yeah. And it's really hard to separate yourself from a thought once you're fused with it. And in acceptance, income and therapy we talk about these techniques called diffusion where essentially you are actively trying to diffuse the bomb in a way. Diffuse the bomb because thoughts can be very devastating, as we talked about, very destructive, but also unfuse yourself from the thought, separating yourself from the thought, knowing that you are a separate entity and that the thought is just a mental event that you as a person of agency is having.

You can't write an email. You can't work out. Your hands are occupied. But what if instead of struggling with it, we just put the piece of paper in your lap? So actually, right now, if it's in your lap, it's closer to your body than if you. When you were pushing it away, which caused a lot of strain and caused you limitations and other things you could do. But now it's in your lap and your hands are free. Right. So let me see your hands. Yeah, they're free. So they're free to do whatever you want to do. They're free to cuddle your wonderful dog, they're free to write an email. But yet the thought itself is actually closer to your body, but you're not struggling with it anymore.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Diffusion\nClient: Dang, I see where this is going, I think.\nClient Emotion: fear\nTherapist: Yeah, so that's one of the analogies that we use. And act, by the way, uses lots of analogies to try to bring forward these ideas. Ideas in a more vivid fashion. And it's this idea of, hey, when you're struggling with something, it actually precludes you from doing things that are meaningful to you. And yet somehow when the thought is closer to you, so they could actually harm you more. Because here it is in your lap, it's like, ah, but at the same time, your hands are free, you can do whatever you want to do, especially things that mean something to you, that matter to you. This is essentially one of the ways that we start to work on this concept of diffusion. From here, there's two ways to work on this exercise. One is just to continue on this route. And essentially now you've written down this thought, you can place it in your pocket, put it on your desk somewhere close to you where you're going to recognize that it's there, understanding that when it comes back up, you can tell yourself, well, I, yeah, I have this thought from time to time. It's actually right here in my pocket. Yeah, but it's written down, it's there, I've acknowledged it. It's also a separate entity from me. Obviously, it's a paper. So it's not me, it's a paper. And I'm freely choosing to put it in my pocket. And I'm choosing to acknowledge that I have the thoughts sometimes and still move forward with whatever I need to do today. What's on my to do list, the things that are important. So that's one way that we can work on that. And it's called card carrying. But I actually want to work on another extension of this exercise, which is to take the paper and I want you to write. Let me see how you wrote the thought so I can see where it's laid out on the paper. Okay, perfect. So now I want you to write it. I want you to write, I guess right now we write underneath it. And we would write. I'm having the thought that. And now if you link those two concepts together, go ahead and Read that out to me. Starting with I'm having the thought that.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Diffusion\nClient: I'm having the thought that I'm not worthy to be a part of this family.

It actually opened up more of my brain to really think about what I'm thinking about what I'm feeling about. Because before when you said give me that specific thought, I was really in a lot of a place of self judgment and ridicule because I was fused with it. And I almost like this technique as a way to explore my real thoughts. Like what other thoughts am I having? Because I'm not so close to them anymore, it's easier for me to identify them and say them. Does that make sense?\nClient Emotion: fear\nTherapist: Absolutely. And that's exactly the kind of reaction many people have when they are able to identify the thought as just the thought that I'm having. So first of all I'm having makes you feel like you're the agent again. I'm having the thought. I'm having the thought, not the thought is not having me. Right. I'm having the thought that.

Kyle is observing thoughts. And so I can sit here and me myself and observe the thought. That's even. It's like an extra step between thinking it without being mindful. And then I'm having the thought that, well, that's still you. And now you're the observer of your thought. So it's one more removed. It's kind of like getting. It feels like you're getting a 30,000 foot view of what's going on in here.", "output": "Client Emotion: joy\nTherapeutic Strategy: Approval\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Yes. I'm so glad that you said that. And this exercise is really important because it also establishes another concept in acceptance and commitment therapy, which is self as context. So we talk about these different versions of self and self concept and oftentimes we talk about the identified self, which actually in acceptance and commitment therapy they call self as content. So this is, I am Kyle, I'm smart, I'm no good. It's these identifications that we put on ourselves in terms of our content, who we are, personality traits, things that are likely to happen to us, et cetera. But selfless context is this really revolutionary idea where essentially the self is context is yourself, the perfect version of yourself that hasn't been through damaging experiences, that doesn't have all of these broken hopes and dreams or negative ideals about yourself, but rather is the observer to everything that's happened in your life and is a pure version of yourself that is resilient and has seen yourself through all the ups and downs of your life. A couple of other analogies to explain self as context is it's like you're the chessboard and the chess pieces in each individual game is kind of the outcomes of different problems you might have in your life. Sometimes the white chess pieces win, sometimes the black chess pieces win. The chessboard sees all of these games, thousands of games in its life, but it's not particularly attached to any single game, yet it's experienced all of them from an observer level. Another analogy is as if you were watching a movie or a play, you're the audience member, you do care about the storyline on stage, but you're not so personally invested in it that it might cause you to do something that could be self defeating. And so it's this idea of understanding that there's the self is context for all of us, that all of us can have this 360 degree view and no matter what is happening right now, we don't have to be attached to the content as much as we're likely to do, because this is just the way that the human brain works. Another extension of this exercise is to look at the paper that you wrote down this thought. And of course below that now you've written, I'm having the thought that. And below that again you wrote, I noticed that. And even looking at the physical placement of the words, you, Kyle, are farther away physically from that original damaging thought. And it's farther away from you physically also. So there's that idea of physical distancing from the thought. And that can also be a powerful imagery for some people where they can say, yeah, before the thought was like, right here, it's like crippling me. And now, wow, there's barriers in between. There's like two layers of protection in some ways between me and this thought."}

You can kind of run things by them in difficult decision points, talk to them about what skills to use. And so it's kind of like an all inclusive package. And most people don't get that level of dbt. But for some conditions and for some severities of conditions, it's indicated they go to an intensive outpatient program where they might receive that type of program. The second way to receive DBT is just, I would like DBT techniques to be interspersed in my treatment. So perhaps you're going to somebody primarily for cbt, but you're saying, hey, can you sprinkle in DBT techniques in our once a week sessions? I would really like that. Knowing though that you're not getting that gold standard model that has been tested in research of this is what works for especially things like borderline personality. But more and more now we have research showing that sort of the sprinkling in of DBT or the once a week sessions of DBT have a lot of utility. And it can help people not only with personality disorders, but it can help people with other mental health conditions as well. And so be clear about what you're asking for and what you're getting.

A lot of people are moving to this virtual therapy style, and a lot of people are curious about what a virtual therapy session might look like. You have been doing them even before the pandemic ran, but obviously in this state, you're doing them all the time. What are you seeing in virtual therapy that you're not seeing in traditional in person therapy?", "output": "Client Emotion: disgust\nTherapeutic Strategy: Communication Skills\nTherapist Emotion: fear\nTherapist: I mean, listen, there's no day I'm ever going to say that virtual therapy is better than in person therapy. We lose so much. Right? I can't see sometimes. I can't see all of a person's body language. I can't. I mean, human beings are meant to be in rooms with each other. That's how we learn to do this. But I have to say there's been some interesting tidbits, though. I'll tell. One thing is that I get to see where people live and some of them are very proud to show me, like, you want to see where I live? And I never get to do that as a therapist. So I've really enjoyed, like, they'll show me art that they have on their wall or photographs or there's a certain interesting pride some have. And I'll also sometimes think how interesting this is and how I thought their house would look. So it's been. I'm getting a piece of information about my clients now. I, strangely enough, do therapy from bed, which sort of makes me feel like some sort of strange. Like strange character in a film because it's a private room in my house. So it's kind of comfortable for me because my legs are up. But it's. It's. I'm trying to make my. My bedroom seem like a therapy room. I can light a candle and I have my water and my tea and all of that, but we definitely are losing something in translation. One of the most difficult things, though, Kyle, I'm seeing is that people don't have privacy at home right now. If anyone lives with another human being, and that could be kids, it could be other adults.

A lot of people are moving to this virtual therapy style, and a lot of people are curious about what a virtual therapy session might look like.

What are you seeing in virtual therapy that you're not seeing in traditional in person therapy?\nClient Emotion: disgust\nTherapist: I mean, listen, there's no day I'm ever going to say that virtual therapy is better than in person therapy. We lose so much. Right? I can't see sometimes. I can't see all of a person's body language. I can't. I mean, human beings are meant to be in rooms with each other. That's how we learn to do this. But I have to say there's been some interesting tidbits, though. I'll tell. One thing is that I get to see where people live and some of them are very proud to show me, like, you want to see where I live? And I never get to do that as a therapist. So I've really enjoyed, like, they'll show me art that they have on their wall or photographs or there's a certain interesting pride some have. And I'll also sometimes think how interesting this is and how I thought their house would look. So it's been. I'm getting a piece of information about my clients now. I, strangely enough, do therapy from bed, which sort of makes me feel like some sort of strange. Like strange character in a film because it's a private room in my house. So it's kind of comfortable for me because my legs are up. But it's. It's. I'm trying to make my. My bedroom seem like a therapy room. I can light a candle and I have my water and my tea and all of that, but we definitely are losing something in translation. One of the most difficult things, though, Kyle, I'm seeing is that people don't have privacy at home right now. If anyone lives with another human being, and that could be kids, it could be other adults. They may be wanting to talk about that in therapy, and they may not feel like now they can be as forthcoming.

But in a virtual space, the stuff of life is still happening around you.\nTherapist Emotion: fear\nTherapeutic Strategy: Communication Skills\nClient: Well, I've shared with MedCircle viewers that I was diagnosed with depression when I was nine years old. I have been diagnosed with depression multiple times since, as I've seen new therapists and new psychiatrists and psychologists. But at this point, I am feeling, and I say that only to say that anxiety never felt like a big issue for me. Certainly there were elements of anxiety, but it was really always more the depression. Until now. I feel like my anxiety is up. And so I like to use. We know this isn't going to be a real therapist or not my therapist. We have a professional and personal relationship. But I feel very comfortable being vulnerable. And I think this will give people a good look into some of the notes that could come up during therapy. So with that in mind, I would love to just kind of have discussion with you about anxiety in this new time.", "output": "Client Emotion: joy\nTherapeutic Strategy: Self-disclosure\nTherapist Emotion: depression\nTherapist: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, it's funny, in my sessions with clients now, we actually have the issues that are happening in the world right now. Pandemic issues, call them isolation issues. And that's the first few minutes of the session. It could have been the whole session. And then we go to real life. Because the fact is, life didn't stop because all of this happened. People still have broken hearts. People are still worried about if they're going to get a good grade on their exam. People still wondering if they should go to law school. People are still angry at their mothers. I mean, the stuff that was happening before is still happening now. And so once we get sort of get past sort of, I call the pandemic session, we move into life. And so. And what's happening, though, is what we've got to remember is anxiety sort of is. It kind of hitches on to everything in our life. So I'll give an example of life. Let's say you have a big deadline at work, okay. And it's not done. And you're feeling really anxious about that deadline. The odds are you're also going to start feeling anxious about other things in your life. Your relationships, your health, whatever it is. Anxiety tends to activate us, and it doesn't know, like, oh, we're only going to be anxious about the deadline. No, anxiety is a feeling. It's an experience in our central nervous system. It's an experience in our bodies, and it's an experience in how we feel and how we think. So it's kind of. It takes over the whole system. Now, when you add to this, like, my deadline isn't your problem, Kyle. Right. So when I'm having a deadline, anxiety about deadline, you're like, oh, I'm sorry you're anxious, but it's not my problem. It's the first time in human history we're all having a shared anxiety simultaneously. Even natural disasters are only focused on the place it's happening. Like the hurricane people are only in the hurricane place. The earthquake people in the earthquake place. This is all of us. So even for those of us as mental health practitioners, we're like, wow, this is the first time we're seeing almost like a collective trauma that's global, a collective anxiety global. There's nobody who has not been affected by this. And so it's definitely. There's something humanizing about it, Kyle. So it's helping me a lot, working with people from the point of view of anxiety. But here's where it gets tricky, is that there's also this sort of global theme of people feeling that I shouldn't be upset about my divorce or my problems with school when the world is falling apart. So people are feeling guilty about their traditional anxiety. So if we were in a session, though, and you were bringing up anxiety, I'd say, just simply tell me what you're. What you're feeling anxious about. Some people roll their eyes, saying, girl, it's very clear what I'm anxious about. And I'll say, actually, no, it's not because some people are anxious about. You name it, getting sick, losing a job, elderly parents. But then some people are anxious about stuff that have nothing to do with what's going on. So it's step one in therapy is to recognize that it's not one size fits all. Is. If I've learned only one thing, we may all be going through a collective event, a collective trauma, a collective anxiety, but every single bus on the planet is having a different experience of it. And in therapy, what you do is you talk about your different experience of it without judging. There is no anxiety that's too small. As far as I'm concerned, your anxiety is yours.

At this point in my life, and perhaps for the first time, it's an underlying constant anxiety where it's. I don't know, I'm pretty healthy, my family's healthy. Yeah, we're going through this whole thing, but like, I wake up and I go, okay, oh, okay, everything's cool. And then I go down to the kitchen and I go, okay, wait, wait. And then I go, okay.

Their friends who are maybe friends and family who are being less than kind. We call them worry, but they worry about everything. And they're saying, you know what? Just anxious. I'm crawling out of my skin. I can't sit still. Free floating anxiety is not an unusual presentation of anxiety. And there's different ways we can meet someone on their free floating anxiety. Now, there's different things that can contribute to free floating anxiety. Some of it is just existing anxiety that people sometimes are anxious kids become anxious adults. So the kids who, when they were six years old would wonder what happens when the sun blows up? What happens when I die? Like, they're those kids who ask those questions. I had a kid who asked those questions, and she's still pretty anxious. You know, they're just. And I was an anxious kid. So I get that. Like, you just. They're just worried kids and they become worried adults and they worry about everything. One thing we do know with free floating anxiety is that a lot of the tools we use for anxiety, things like mindfulness meditation and breathing work really well. And so those would be sort of one of the things we are doing. All of us who are doing, working with clients right now, even Virtually and it's not as satisfying, but we could definitely do it is work on a mindfulness exercise right then and there. Because remember when we have free floating anxiety, it's a combination of worrying and worrying about the future, which are both kind of pointless because the past can't be changed and the future hasn't happened. So we're like, what is happening now? And I, this is a psychologist, is the. I've never seen this.

So let me use one of the techniques I'm trying a lot of my clients, which is washing. We're supposed to wash our hands like 30 times now, right? Every time you wash your hands, that's a misintervention. So Kyle, an interesting place we can start with you is let's do something we're all having to do 20 times a day, which is Hand Washington. So you said you're feeling this free floating anxiety. A great place to start for you would be again, this thing you're having to do and it has a lot of sensation involved in it. Right. When you turn on the water and you pay attention to the temperature of the water flow of the water on your hands. I'm telling everyone, if you can use a soap that has a smell you like, that's great because that's one more sense you can be aware of. You put the soap in your hand and you feel whether it's a bar of soap or liquid soap, you feel the sensation of the soap. Then you're moving your hands and you're paying attention to the sensation of moving your hands, the soap between your fingers, the temperature of the water. Ideally you even close your eyes during this and do some breathing or if you keep your eyes open, reflect on the color of the color of the suds and all that. This may seem silly, but it's actually not. Because for that 45 seconds, if you become immersed in Hand Washington, it's almost like a little bit of a reboot, a tiny little reboot that you out of the worry, as it were, the free floating anxiety. And it then becomes a technique that you realize like you can draw upon and there's other ways you can do this. One technique that all of us are talking about it's something you can use a lot is breathing when you have a moment, when that anxiety is hitting you and hitting you hard. Literally that breathing in, holding it, and then a slower exhale. Paying attention to how you feel is also another really useful technique. It's just like a. You can grab when you're feeling that anxiety. And you'd be amazed if you want to even try that now. Like, just eyes open, eyes closed, whatever you prefer. But take a slow inhale, pay attention to how your body's feeling and holding that inhale, and then slowly, ideally through your nose, letting that breath go and feeling this inside of your body, of your shoulders, maybe coming down. Yeah, it does change you. It does change you. And that's something you can use out the day."}
{"instruction": "You are a compassionate and skilled therapist with tons of experience.\nUsing past conversations context, for each client input: \n(1) Identify the client's emotion; \n(2) Reflect on your emotion as the therapist; \n(3) Determine a therapeutic strategy\n(4) Provide a compassionate and helpful response.\n", "input": "Past Conversation Context:\nTherapist: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, it's funny, in my sessions with clients now, we actually have the issues that are happening in the world right now. Pandemic issues, call them isolation issues. And that's the first few minutes of the session. It could have been the whole session. And then we go to real life. Because the fact is, life didn't stop because all of this happened. People still have broken hearts. People are still worried about if they're going to get a good grade on their exam. People still wondering if they should go to law school. People are still angry at their mothers. I mean, the stuff that was happening before is still happening now. And so once we get sort of get past sort of, I call the pandemic session, we move into life. And so. And what's happening, though, is what we've got to remember is anxiety sort of is. It kind of hitches on to everything in our life. So I'll give an example of life. Let's say you have a big deadline at work, okay. And it's not done. And you're feeling really anxious about that deadline. The odds are you're also going to start feeling anxious about other things in your life. Your relationships, your health, whatever it is. Anxiety tends to activate us, and it doesn't know, like, oh, we're only going to be anxious about the deadline. No, anxiety is a feeling. It's an experience in our central nervous system. It's an experience in our bodies, and it's an experience in how we feel and how we think. So it's kind of. It takes over the whole system. Now, when you add to this, like, my deadline isn't your problem, Kyle. Right. So when I'm having a deadline, anxiety about deadline, you're like, oh, I'm sorry you're anxious, but it's not my problem. It's the first time in human history we're all having a shared anxiety simultaneously. Even natural disasters are only focused on the place it's happening. Like the hurricane people are only in the hurricane place. The earthquake people in the earthquake place. This is all of us. So even for those of us as mental health practitioners, we're like, wow, this is the first time we're seeing almost like a collective trauma that's global, a collective anxiety global. There's nobody who has not been affected by this. And so it's definitely. There's something humanizing about it, Kyle. So it's helping me a lot, working with people from the point of view of anxiety. But here's where it gets tricky, is that there's also this sort of global theme of people feeling that I shouldn't be upset about my divorce or my problems with school when the world is falling apart. So people are feeling guilty about their traditional anxiety. So if we were in a session, though, and you were bringing up anxiety, I'd say, just simply tell me what you're. What you're feeling anxious about. Some people roll their eyes, saying, girl, it's very clear what I'm anxious about. And I'll say, actually, no, it's not because some people are anxious about. You name it, getting sick, losing a job, elderly parents. But then some people are anxious about stuff that have nothing to do with what's going on. So it's step one in therapy is to recognize that it's not one size fits all. Is. If I've learned only one thing, we may all be going through a collective event, a collective trauma, a collective anxiety, but every single bus on the planet is having a different experience of it. And in therapy, what you do is you talk about your different experience of it without judging. There is no anxiety that's too small. As far as I'm concerned, your anxiety is yours. And that makes it valid.\nTherapist Emotion: depression\nTherapeutic Strategy: Self-disclosure\nClient: Let's get into my anxieties then. I cannot tie my anxiety to one thing. When you ask, when you ask the question, well, what are. Where is your anxiety coming from? Or what are you anxious about? At this point in my life, and perhaps for the first time, it's an underlying constant anxiety where it's. I don't know, I'm pretty healthy, my family's healthy. Yeah, we're going through this whole thing, but like, I wake up and I go, okay, oh, okay, everything's cool. And then I go down to the kitchen and I go, okay, wait, wait. And then I go, okay. Is I constantly have to remind myself that I'm not in danger.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nClient Emotion Analysis: The speaker appears to be in a state of anger and frustration. Their emotional expression and posture suggest that they may be experiencing a significant amount of stress or distress in their personal or professional life.\nTherapist: So this is something that we call free floating anxiety. It has a name, okay? And many, many people, before any of what's happening in the world happened, were living with free floating anxiety all the time. Their friends who are maybe friends and family who are being less than kind. We call them worry, but they worry about everything. And they're saying, you know what? Just anxious. I'm crawling out of my skin. I can't sit still. Free floating anxiety is not an unusual presentation of anxiety. And there's different ways we can meet someone on their free floating anxiety. Now, there's different things that can contribute to free floating anxiety. Some of it is just existing anxiety that people sometimes are anxious kids become anxious adults. So the kids who, when they were six years old would wonder what happens when the sun blows up? What happens when I die? Like, they're those kids who ask those questions. I had a kid who asked those questions, and she's still pretty anxious. You know, they're just. And I was an anxious kid. So I get that. Like, you just. They're just worried kids and they become worried adults and they worry about everything. One thing we do know with free floating anxiety is that a lot of the tools we use for anxiety, things like mindfulness meditation and breathing work really well. And so those would be sort of one of the things we are doing. All of us who are doing, working with clients right now, even Virtually and it's not as satisfying, but we could definitely do it is work on a mindfulness exercise right then and there. Because remember when we have free floating anxiety, it's a combination of worrying and worrying about the future, which are both kind of pointless because the past can't be changed and the future hasn't happened. So we're like, what is happening now? And I, this is a psychologist, is the. I've never seen this. And it's become the best time in history, maybe in at least in contemporary human history to work fullness because nobody. It's the first time we're all sort of like to work on what to work on mindfulness.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Open questions\nClient: Oh, on mindfulness, yeah.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Because mindfulness really forces us into the present moment and when you're having free flowing anxiety. So let me use one of the techniques I'm trying a lot of my clients, which is washing. We're supposed to wash our hands like 30 times now, right? Every time you wash your hands, that's a misintervention. So Kyle, an interesting place we can start with you is let's do something we're all having to do 20 times a day, which is Hand Washington. So you said you're feeling this free floating anxiety. A great place to start for you would be again, this thing you're having to do and it has a lot of sensation involved in it. Right. When you turn on the water and you pay attention to the temperature of the water flow of the water on your hands. I'm telling everyone, if you can use a soap that has a smell you like, that's great because that's one more sense you can be aware of. You put the soap in your hand and you feel whether it's a bar of soap or liquid soap, you feel the sensation of the soap. Then you're moving your hands and you're paying attention to the sensation of moving your hands, the soap between your fingers, the temperature of the water. Ideally you even close your eyes during this and do some breathing or if you keep your eyes open, reflect on the color of the color of the suds and all that. This may seem silly, but it's actually not. Because for that 45 seconds, if you become immersed in Hand Washington, it's almost like a little bit of a reboot, a tiny little reboot that you out of the worry, as it were, the free floating anxiety. And it then becomes a technique that you realize like you can draw upon and there's other ways you can do this. One technique that all of us are talking about it's something you can use a lot is breathing when you have a moment, when that anxiety is hitting you and hitting you hard.

So I think actually we're going to see in retrospect, many people are actually attempting to log more hours of sleep. People are also bored. There's just nothing to do. At some point, I'm just going to go to sleep. But as with all sleep issues and anxiety and sleep problems are really, really linked. We'd want to do for you is review your whole sleep things, as it were. Like, we might want you to get tired in another room and only move to bed when you're ready to call it quits. Make sense?"}

And that's going to contribute to a sense of anxiety as you start addressing the beliefs and using different language to express them again. The breaking down of the thoughts allows you to start thinking about alternative responses. Because right now, what's happened, Kyle, is there's a conditioning. Somebody calls you watch this video. It's almost the physiological reaction for you almost happens before the words come out. You're like, absolutely not. No, no, no. I can't believe it's happening. You immediately spin into distress. If you have that ability to go to your thoughts and say, I see what's happening. Here I am. These kinds of videos are triggering for me. I can give myself permission to not watch this and communicate with someone and say, you know what? I'm going to. You know, as always, I'm continuing in my advocacy efforts. And I would say, Kyle, the struggle is if there's people in your purview, people you know, you might be getting these videos sent to you from people who don't even know you, but from people who do, you can. You can set a boundary again, that's an idea of taking back some sense of control over the situation, which is what helps us with anxiety, but then also giving yourself permission to have an alternative response. You know that I don't need to respond to every email like this, but I am already now doing this each day or each week to respond to this and then work towards the acceptance piece. But in the initial phase, Kyle, and a lot of the monitoring for you initially is it's going to feel uncomfortable to not respond to everyone. And that discomfort may not only be feeling the feeling of anxiety, but also understand it's part of the process of letting go of this cycle and that you can then set something for yourself that feels more comfortable. Like I said, something you do every week in an advocacy capacity, but in the interim, you have to tolerate the uncomfortable feelings. That's what's hard, because those feelings aren't going to destroy you. And I think that's what a lot of people believe. This feeling is going to break me. This feeling is going to kill me. And to say, no, the feeling can't kill me. And you literally have to give yourself that reminder. In fact, in very classical cognitive behavioral therapy, people are instructed to wear an elastic band around their wrist and snap it into their negative self. Talk like, oh, my God, I'm such a bad person. I'm not helping the animals snap. So you stop that negative sequence, instead saying, okay, I don't have to respond to this. I certainly don't need to watch this imagery. And I can keep doing the things I'm doing that are helping me do one piece of advocacy in this."}

This has failed before. We've even got you up this morning, Right? So when you look at that in that way, you start seeing how, in essence, you've set yourself to, if you will fail. And that's going to contribute to a sense of anxiety as you start addressing the beliefs and using different language to express them again. The breaking down of the thoughts allows you to start thinking about alternative responses. Because right now, what's happened, Kyle, is there's a conditioning. Somebody calls you watch this video. It's almost the physiological reaction for you almost happens before the words come out. You're like, absolutely not. No, no, no. I can't believe it's happening. You immediately spin into distress. If you have that ability to go to your thoughts and say, I see what's happening. Here I am. These kinds of videos are triggering for me. I can give myself permission to not watch this and communicate with someone and say, you know what? I'm going to. You know, as always, I'm continuing in my advocacy efforts. And I would say, Kyle, the struggle is if there's people in your purview, people you know, you might be getting these videos sent to you from people who don't even know you, but from people who do, you can. You can set a boundary again, that's an idea of taking back some sense of control over the situation, which is what helps us with anxiety, but then also giving yourself permission to have an alternative response. You know that I don't need to respond to every email like this, but I am already now doing this each day or each week to respond to this and then work towards the acceptance piece. But in the initial phase, Kyle, and a lot of the monitoring for you initially is it's going to feel uncomfortable to not respond to everyone. And that discomfort may not only be feeling the feeling of anxiety, but also understand it's part of the process of letting go of this cycle and that you can then set something for yourself that feels more comfortable. Like I said, something you do every week in an advocacy capacity, but in the interim, you have to tolerate the uncomfortable feelings. That's what's hard, because those feelings aren't going to destroy you. And I think that's what a lot of people believe. This feeling is going to break me. This feeling is going to kill me. And to say, no, the feeling can't kill me. And you literally have to give yourself that reminder. In fact, in very classical cognitive behavioral therapy, people are instructed to wear an elastic band around their wrist and snap it into their negative self. Talk like, oh, my God, I'm such a bad person. I'm not helping the animals snap. So you stop that negative sequence, instead saying, okay, I don't have to respond to this. I certainly don't need to watch this imagery. And I can keep doing the things I'm doing that are helping me do one piece of advocacy in this.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Interpretation\nClient: Thank you.

I don't know if you know what a riptide is, but a riptide is an ocean current that comes close to shore, but that can pull you out. But ultimately a riptide will actually bring you back into the shore or you'll break out of it. And then people want to swim right back to the shore and they try to fight the riptide, which makes it worse, and then they exhaust themselves.

But think of it as that riptide. None of us ever swim out of them. We've got to figure out our way of swimming parallel to the shore. The riptide will let you go.

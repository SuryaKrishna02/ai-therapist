And I have to say when I hear that, it always concerns me because at some level I often think to myself, like, ah, this person is going to be perceived as so strong by everyone. Like, you're right, what do you have to complain about? Right? But I have to tell you, I once read this book by a woman named Dr. Edith Eager and she did such a beautiful job. She really sort of, she's sort of the, like a very female parallel voice to Viktor Frankl. And in her book, it's called the Gift, she writes about this idea of. So often we feel like we either don't get to be in, we don't get to complain about our lot in life because some people have it worse, or she gave a great example of a person getting aggravated at someone, like a therapist getting aggravated at someone for complaining, thinking, how could you be complaining about this? Like, you know, thinking like as a therapist two hours before I might have been hearing someone who has a much worse problem. Right. But what Dr. Eaker says is that the therapist has to be masterful at being able to, at being able to understand that everyone's crisis is their crisis from a subjective point of view. For one person, not being able to get to their nail salon when it could open felt tragic to them. For another person processing the suicide of their child. And you're like, can these be these two things be compared? And Dr. Eager would say yes, because in both cases that person had a negative mood experience and we don't get to judge it. And I have to say her writing has been quite influential for me and again builds on Dr. Frankl's work as well. So it's this idea that we don't get to judge, not as therapists, nor do we get to judge ourselves as individuals. Your pain is your pain. And so that theme really struck me hard about you. And then I wanted to get to the core of where that came from. And that's where your history came in. And I do know you're gay and I knew that very much. So that people who have statuses, who maintain, who hold roles, I should say role statuses that are marginalized by society are often the ones who judge themselves most harshly because society already does that for you. That societal judgment almost passively gets internalized and as a result, people who live within marginalized roles and statuses are more likely to self pathologize than other groups."}

I'm glad we were able to do something that would teach people. Let me tell you though, part of what I think we were able to do here that I hope and wish more people would get in therapy, that's that idea of understanding those internalized societal messages. I think that too often therapy doesn't integrate that. We're so focused on the closed system of the individual that we don't weigh in on what structural, systemic issues do to a person and how that can actually be a major driver to our mental health. One of the biggest problems to me in psychotherapy is the unwillingness to consider all of that, the outsideness of it all. Listen, I practice in Los Angeles and a significant proportion of people bring at least one kind of marginalized status, whether I guess a gender, race, ethnicity, whatever. And it's not like I'm saying that that's the sole explanatory mechanism, but it really does help sometimes understand that volley between in and out. And I think a lot of people don't think of it that way. And why a lot of people don't is they're almost afraid of feeling like they're blaming the world for their problems or they're putting themselves in a victimized stance. And at no point were you doing that. If anything, you were really almost self shaming, self harming and self gaslighting. And so it's to sort of break you out of that cycle. Because for me, the win with you would be for you to give permission to yourself to be able to be okay with not being okay, so that you'd be get. You'd get back to okay. A lot more quickly that this idea that my feeling sad and my feeling tired doesn't get to happen because someone else lost a child or lost their job is. It's, it's a, it's comparing to. It's like comparing. It's not even apples and oranges. It's like hammers and cows. Like there's literally no, like they're not even fruit. Like they're not even common. And so, and I think that one of the problems is, is that we have this sort of intersubjectivity. Like I can only judge my experience on the basis of someone else's experience. We humans do that. We're a tribal species, right. We tend to look outside of us. But it's also being able to know that no more and no more than I judge myself. For example, let's say it's a warm day and I feel cold. It's tempting to say, oh gosh, there's something wrong with me, I'm cold, I'm cold. We tend to be more comfortable doing it with physical states. I'm cold, I'm hungry, that sort of stuff. We don't judge, but when it comes to our emotions, we judge. And that's, that's what I would love for, if we had worked together, what we would keep working on. So, you know, a few takeaways, Kyle, would be, you know, number one is pay attention to how you talk to yourself, right? So if someone was talking to you the way you were talking to yourself, you'd be like, hey, like hello, you need to step back because this isn't."}
{"instruction": "You are a compassionate and skilled therapist with tons of experience.\nUsing past conversations context, for each client input: \n(1) Identify the client's emotion; \n(2) Reflect on your emotion as the therapist; \n(3) Determine a therapeutic strategy\n(4) Provide a compassionate and helpful response.\n\n\nPast Conversation Context:\nTherapist: You told me how you're feeling. You told me how you've been feeling like this for a long time. You gave me a glimpse into your mental health history and your physical health history and how they kind of come together. You let me know that you obviously had solicitous parents who encouraged therapy, but then you really were able to pivot into the space of being able to talk about the guilt and then ultimately the shame you felt about having. Having any negative thoughts about your life in light of the fact that people have it so much worse. Right. This kind of. It says it's a very, it's a very stoic kind of, who the heck am I to complain when people have it so much worse? Where. And I have to say when I hear that, it always concerns me because at some level I often think to myself, like, ah, this person is going to be perceived as so strong by everyone. Like, you're right, what do you have to complain about? Right? But I have to tell you, I once read this book by a woman named Dr. Edith Eager and she did such a beautiful job. She really sort of, she's sort of the, like a very female parallel voice to Viktor Frankl. And in her book, it's called the Gift, she writes about this idea of. So often we feel like we either don't get to be in, we don't get to complain about our lot in life because some people have it worse, or she gave a great example of a person getting aggravated at someone, like a therapist getting aggravated at someone for complaining, thinking, how could you be complaining about this? Like, you know, thinking like as a therapist two hours before I might have been hearing someone who has a much worse problem. Right. But what Dr. Eaker says is that the therapist has to be masterful at being able to, at being able to understand that everyone's crisis is their crisis from a subjective point of view. For one person, not being able to get to their nail salon when it could open felt tragic to them. For another person processing the suicide of their child. And you're like, can these be these two things be compared? And Dr. Eager would say yes, because in both cases that person had a negative mood experience and we don't get to judge it. And I have to say her writing has been quite influential for me and again builds on Dr. Frankl's work as well. So it's this idea that we don't get to judge, not as therapists, nor do we get to judge ourselves as individuals. Your pain is your pain. And so that theme really struck me hard about you. And then I wanted to get to the core of where that came from. And that's where your history came in. And I do know you're gay and I knew that very much. So that people who have statuses, who maintain, who hold roles, I should say role statuses that are marginalized by society are often the ones who judge themselves most harshly because society already does that for you. That societal judgment almost passively gets internalized and as a result, people who live within marginalized roles and statuses are more likely to self pathologize than other groups.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Self-disclosure\nClient: Yeah, look you really nailed it. You really nailed it. When you tied it all together at the end, I felt all of it being tied together in my brain. That's how in line it was with what was going on in my head. What you were saying, which really made me feel heard, I think that was my reaction was not just the realization of where these feelings are coming from, but also, oh my gosh, this woman in 10 minutes understood what I was talking about. I've been to a lot of therapy, Dr. Ramani, and those moments that I just had with you, truly in 15 minutes. I mean, I don't have a lot. I don't have those every therapy session. You know what I mean?\nClient Emotion: joy\nTherapist: That's good.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Restatement\nClient: It's a build. I don't have any good questions. I probably have some stupid questions, but. Bridget, are there any questions I can ask about this? I'm too emotional right now.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Kyle, first of all, thank you.

So, you know, a few takeaways, Kyle, would be, you know, number one is pay attention to how you talk to yourself, right?

So part of this becomes mindful self monitoring of your own self talk, which is never easy to do because the self talk is such a passive experience that's internal to us, right? So I'd love for you to spend more time being more mindful and aware on how you talk to yourself. Number two, I'd love for you to do almost like a one or two week experiment where you honor your moods and be with them. So when your body is telling you you're tired, instead of saying, oh my God, Kyle, what's wrong with you? So many people have it worse. Say, I'm going to honor, almost like talk to your body. Maybe not do it in front of other people, but honor your body and say, you tired, let's go rest and go and take care of you, right? Instead of yelling at you, take care of you. So you're tired, let's go, let's go take rest. Because I think after a while, once your body and your psyche connect and feel confident like our host has got us, like, we will be okay. We know we're going to be taken care of together, you might actually feel better. Does that make sense? Like, if I know I'm going to someone's house and they're going to be like, you want to take some rest, you want to take a shower, you want something to eat? I feel taken care of. But if they're like, you're going to do everything on my agenda and I'm going to wake you up at 4 in the morning and then I'm going to make you go to bed at 10. We're going to only talk about what I want, eat what I want. I'll be like, I don't want to be here. Right. And I'd feel tense and upset. Well, I want you to be a better host. And so I want you to just sort of work on some of that very simple self compassion, listening to yourself. Because I'm hearing you won't take advantage of that. Like, you won't say, okay, I'm going to stay in bed for two weeks. I think you'll say, I got my rest, I'm good. And you know that you'll honor your need for rest when you may need it at a later, you know, at a later time. Those would be two things that I'd really want you to work on again. Especially that mindfulness, Staying in the moment, being with your feelings and not judging them. And as a third enhancement, you may want to consider journaling. Journaling can take a lot of forms. And sometimes people like, I am not writing Dear Diary every day, and I'm not telling you to do that. Sometimes it's as simple. I tell some of my clients, you don't feel like journaling every day. Give yourself a little rating. I actually have an app, and it goes off at whatever time it goes off. And I can actually rate my. I can rate my moods, if that makes sense. Right. I can rate my, you know, like, did I have a good day? Did I have a bad day? Am I tired? Am I sad, Am I this, am I that? So it gives me a chance to just sort of like touch base. And over time I get data. I can look at that data over time and say, oh, wow, that was a bad week, or this is a better week, or what was it about that day that was better or worse? So keeping that kind either through a mood tracking app or jotting a few things down. Watching the ebbs and the flows of time? That can help too."}

Diffuse the bomb because thoughts can be very devastating, as we talked about, very destructive, but also unfuse yourself from the thought, separating yourself from the thought, knowing that you are a separate entity and that the thought is just a mental event that you as a person of agency is having. And that can be very empowering and can also help so that there aren't this cascade of negative thoughts that follow along with the emotional reactions and the self sabotaging, self defeating actions that you actually just gave a good example of. So my favorite way of working on one of my diffusion techniques is to have you actually write out the thought that you're. That you just spoke to me. So if you have a piece of paper handy, go ahead and write it down on the paper.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Challenging and examining the validity of the client's thoughts and beliefs, and teaching them how to observe and detach from their thoughts rather than fusing with them.\nClient: Or write down the thought itself.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Yes, write down the thought itself.

Let me see how you wrote the thought so I can see where it's laid out on the paper. Okay, perfect. So now I want you to write it. I want you to write, I guess right now we write underneath it. And we would write. I'm having the thought that. And now if you link those two concepts together, go ahead and Read that out to me. Starting with I'm having the thought that.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Diffusion\nClient: I'm having the thought that I'm not worthy to be a part of this family. I can tell you as soon as I wrote I'm not or as soon as I wrote I'm having the thought that what it actually did for me just now is it. It actually opened up more of my brain to really think about what I'm thinking about what I'm feeling about. Because before when you said give me that specific thought, I was really in a lot of a place of self judgment and ridicule because I was fused with it. And I almost like this technique as a way to explore my real thoughts. Like what other thoughts am I having? Because I'm not so close to them anymore, it's easier for me to identify them and say them. Does that make sense?\nClient Emotion: fear\nTherapist: Absolutely. And that's exactly the kind of reaction many people have when they are able to identify the thought as just the thought that I'm having. So first of all I'm having makes you feel like you're the agent again. I'm having the thought. I'm having the thought, not the thought is not having me. Right. I'm having the thought that. And then you filled in the rest. I'm not worthy enough to be part of this family. But now I would like you to add another clause below that, which is. I notice that. So now read the entire sequence together.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Open questions\nClient: Starting with I notice that I noticed that I'm having the thought that I'm not worthy to be a part of this family.\nClient Emotion: sadness\nTherapist: Okay, so what do you think that has added for you that last clause of. I noticed that.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Restatement", "input": "Client: Well, two things. One, space between me and the thought and the fact that my brain is a observer of thoughts. Kyle is observing thoughts. And so I can sit here and me myself and observe the thought. That's even. It's like an extra step between thinking it without being mindful. And then I'm having the thought that, well, that's still you. And now you're the observer of your thought. So it's one more removed. It's kind of like getting. It feels like you're getting a 30,000 foot view of what's going on in here.", "output": "Client Emotion: joy\nTherapeutic Strategy: Approval\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Yes. I'm so glad that you said that. And this exercise is really important because it also establishes another concept in acceptance and commitment therapy, which is self as context. So we talk about these different versions of self and self concept and oftentimes we talk about the identified self, which actually in acceptance and commitment therapy they call self as content. So this is, I am Kyle, I'm smart, I'm no good. It's these identifications that we put on ourselves in terms of our content, who we are, personality traits, things that are likely to happen to us, et cetera. But selfless context is this really revolutionary idea where essentially the self is context is yourself, the perfect version of yourself that hasn't been through damaging experiences, that doesn't have all of these broken hopes and dreams or negative ideals about yourself, but rather is the observer to everything that's happened in your life and is a pure version of yourself that is resilient and has seen yourself through all the ups and downs of your life. A couple of other analogies to explain self as context is it's like you're the chessboard and the chess pieces in each individual game is kind of the outcomes of different problems you might have in your life. Sometimes the white chess pieces win, sometimes the black chess pieces win. The chessboard sees all of these games, thousands of games in its life, but it's not particularly attached to any single game, yet it's experienced all of them from an observer level. Another analogy is as if you were watching a movie or a play, you're the audience member, you do care about the storyline on stage, but you're not so personally invested in it that it might cause you to do something that could be self defeating. And so it's this idea of understanding that there's the self is context for all of us, that all of us can have this 360 degree view and no matter what is happening right now, we don't have to be attached to the content as much as we're likely to do, because this is just the way that the human brain works. Another extension of this exercise is to look at the paper that you wrote down this thought. And of course below that now you've written, I'm having the thought that. And below that again you wrote, I noticed that. And even looking at the physical placement of the words, you, Kyle, are farther away physically from that original damaging thought. And it's farther away from you physically also. So there's that idea of physical distancing from the thought. And that can also be a powerful imagery for some people where they can say, yeah, before the thought was like, right here, it's like crippling me. And now, wow, there's barriers in between. There's like two layers of protection in some ways between me and this thought."}

You can kind of run things by them in difficult decision points, talk to them about what skills to use. And so it's kind of like an all inclusive package. And most people don't get that level of dbt. But for some conditions and for some severities of conditions, it's indicated they go to an intensive outpatient program where they might receive that type of program. The second way to receive DBT is just, I would like DBT techniques to be interspersed in my treatment. So perhaps you're going to somebody primarily for cbt, but you're saying, hey, can you sprinkle in DBT techniques in our once a week sessions? I would really like that. Knowing though that you're not getting that gold standard model that has been tested in research of this is what works for especially things like borderline personality. But more and more now we have research showing that sort of the sprinkling in of DBT or the once a week sessions of DBT have a lot of utility. And it can help people not only with personality disorders, but it can help people with other mental health conditions as well. And so be clear about what you're asking for and what you're getting.

For example, if you want me to talk to your physician because a physical condition or medication you're taking could be affecting your mood, you might sign a release that allows me to communicate with your physician. Oftentimes the physician will require the same thing. So there will actually be two releases, one that he or she keeps and one that I keep.

Even though releases have to be in writing to be in effect, except in extreme circumstances, you can discontinue a release at any time by calling the agency and telling them that you want a release canceled. So say that you know, and I have no reason to believe this is the case, but say you have a family member that comes in and there's a session and it goes, okay, but then your relationship with that family member brings to a later point, and now you think, well, I don't want them calling in and being able to talk to your counselor. All you have to do is call in and the administrative staff will cancel that. Okay. If you do that, that's fine. But also, next time you see me, tell me and I'll double check and make sure that it's been canceled in your chart. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay. Another exception to confidentiality is what's called continuity of care, meaning you're here at agency and you're seeing me. But a lot of other people work here and have some investment or duties related to your care. For example, somebody has to file the charts. Somebody has to do the billing. There's a director to this agency, right. That has an interest in your care as well. So I'm permitted to speak to those individuals about things that we talk about. I only do so to the extent that I need to. For example, if I'm talking to a person at billing, I'm not going to tell them about deep, dark secrets you may have in your life, in your family history or something. Right. I'm going to talk about what they need to know, which is usually, what type of insurance does she have? Or is there a change in insurance coming or something like that. The questions they're asking me aren't typically of personal nature, and if they were, I wouldn't answer them. However, with the director of the agency, that would be a different level of disclosure. Does that make sense? Because they're a clinical. They're a clinical person."}

And I want to explain to you the certain circumstances under which confidentiality might be broken.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Advisement\nClient: Okay.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: All right. So let's start at everything's confidential, and then I'll explain the exceptions to you. Does that make sense? Sure. Okay. Probably the largest exception, one of the most frequently used exceptions is if you sign a release for me to break confidentiality. This is not uncommon. For example, if you want me to talk to your physician because a physical condition or medication you're taking could be affecting your mood, you might sign a release that allows me to communicate with your physician. Oftentimes the physician will require the same thing. So there will actually be two releases, one that he or she keeps and one that I keep. Similarly, if you have a family member that you want to bring in for a session because somehow it might be related to what's going on with you. You would have to sign a release. If you did that, I then could communicate with that family member.\nTherapist Emotion: sadness\nTherapeutic Strategy: Communication Skills\nClient: Oh, okay.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Does that make sense? Even though releases have to be in writing to be in effect, except in extreme circumstances, you can discontinue a release at any time by calling the agency and telling them that you want a release canceled. So say that you know, and I have no reason to believe this is the case, but say you have a family member that comes in and there's a session and it goes, okay, but then your relationship with that family member brings to a later point, and now you think, well, I don't want them calling in and being able to talk to your counselor. All you have to do is call in and the administrative staff will cancel that. Okay. If you do that, that's fine. But also, next time you see me, tell me and I'll double check and make sure that it's been canceled in your chart. Okay? Does that make sense? Okay. Another exception to confidentiality is what's called continuity of care, meaning you're here at agency and you're seeing me. But a lot of other people work here and have some investment or duties related to your care. For example, somebody has to file the charts. Somebody has to do the billing. There's a director to this agency, right. That has an interest in your care as well. So I'm permitted to speak to those individuals about things that we talk about. I only do so to the extent that I need to. For example, if I'm talking to a person at billing, I'm not going to tell them about deep, dark secrets you may have in your life, in your family history or something. Right. I'm going to talk about what they need to know, which is usually, what type of insurance does she have? Or is there a change in insurance coming or something like that. The questions they're asking me aren't typically of personal nature, and if they were, I wouldn't answer them. However, with the director of the agency, that would be a different level of disclosure. Does that make sense? Because they're a clinical. They're a clinical person.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Interpretation", "input": "Client: So you can tell them my deep, dark secrets.", "output": "Client Emotion: sadness\nTherapeutic Strategy: Structuring the therapy\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: I could.

And I would have to report that. Okay. And again, I would just give them the information they need to try to prevent any harm to the child or an elderly person. Does that make sense? Okay. And the last exception to confidentiality would be. And this is very rare, but it can happen, so I won't tell you about it. If for some reason during the course of this therapy or even after this therapy has terminated, you get involved with the civil legal system and the criminal legal system, and a judge orders me to disclose information from your chart or from our experiences. Okay. Technically, a judge can do that. And I would have to follow his or her orders before I would make any such disclosure. I would certainly make my case to the judge that I don't want to make that disclosure and try to restrict that disclosure as much as possible. But in the end, it's important to know that I don't have the power to make the final decision. It would be in the hands of the judge. Again, this happens very rarely, but I do want to let you know that it's an exception to confidentiality.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Approval\nClient: Okay.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Okay.

And so once we get sort of get past sort of, I call the pandemic session, we move into life. And so. And what's happening, though, is what we've got to remember is anxiety sort of is. It kind of hitches on to everything in our life. So I'll give an example of life. Let's say you have a big deadline at work, okay. And it's not done. And you're feeling really anxious about that deadline. The odds are you're also going to start feeling anxious about other things in your life. Your relationships, your health, whatever it is. Anxiety tends to activate us, and it doesn't know, like, oh, we're only going to be anxious about the deadline. No, anxiety is a feeling. It's an experience in our central nervous system. It's an experience in our bodies, and it's an experience in how we feel and how we think. So it's kind of. It takes over the whole system. Now, when you add to this, like, my deadline isn't your problem, Kyle. Right. So when I'm having a deadline, anxiety about deadline, you're like, oh, I'm sorry you're anxious, but it's not my problem. It's the first time in human history we're all having a shared anxiety simultaneously. Even natural disasters are only focused on the place it's happening. Like the hurricane people are only in the hurricane place. The earthquake people in the earthquake place. This is all of us. So even for those of us as mental health practitioners, we're like, wow, this is the first time we're seeing almost like a collective trauma that's global, a collective anxiety global. There's nobody who has not been affected by this. And so it's definitely. There's something humanizing about it, Kyle. So it's helping me a lot, working with people from the point of view of anxiety. But here's where it gets tricky, is that there's also this sort of global theme of people feeling that I shouldn't be upset about my divorce or my problems with school when the world is falling apart. So people are feeling guilty about their traditional anxiety. So if we were in a session, though, and you were bringing up anxiety, I'd say, just simply tell me what you're. What you're feeling anxious about. Some people roll their eyes, saying, girl, it's very clear what I'm anxious about. And I'll say, actually, no, it's not because some people are anxious about. You name it, getting sick, losing a job, elderly parents. But then some people are anxious about stuff that have nothing to do with what's going on. So it's step one in therapy is to recognize that it's not one size fits all. Is. If I've learned only one thing, we may all be going through a collective event, a collective trauma, a collective anxiety, but every single bus on the planet is having a different experience of it. And in therapy, what you do is you talk about your different experience of it without judging. There is no anxiety that's too small. As far as I'm concerned, your anxiety is yours.

A lot of people are moving to this virtual therapy style, and a lot of people are curious about what a virtual therapy session might look like. You have been doing them even before the pandemic ran, but obviously in this state, you're doing them all the time. What are you seeing in virtual therapy that you're not seeing in traditional in person therapy?\nClient Emotion: disgust\nTherapist: I mean, listen, there's no day I'm ever going to say that virtual therapy is better than in person therapy. We lose so much. Right? I can't see sometimes. I can't see all of a person's body language. I can't. I mean, human beings are meant to be in rooms with each other. That's how we learn to do this. But I have to say there's been some interesting tidbits, though. I'll tell. One thing is that I get to see where people live and some of them are very proud to show me, like, you want to see where I live? And I never get to do that as a therapist. So I've really enjoyed, like, they'll show me art that they have on their wall or photographs or there's a certain interesting pride some have. And I'll also sometimes think how interesting this is and how I thought their house would look. So it's been. I'm getting a piece of information about my clients now. I, strangely enough, do therapy from bed, which sort of makes me feel like some sort of strange. Like strange character in a film because it's a private room in my house. So it's kind of comfortable for me because my legs are up. But it's. It's. I'm trying to make my. My bedroom seem like a therapy room. I can light a candle and I have my water and my tea and all of that, but we definitely are losing something in translation. One of the most difficult things, though, Kyle, I'm seeing is that people don't have privacy at home right now. If anyone lives with another human being, and that could be kids, it could be other adults. They may be wanting to talk about that in therapy, and they may not feel like now they can be as forthcoming. For I have to clients say, I'm going to put this until I have privacy because this is now a pointless endeavor. Some people will do it by phone in their car. They'll drive their car, walks away and do it from their car. So people are finding different kinds of solutions to this that we never actually had to think. Therapy rooms are private space, but it's. Yeah, definitely. Something's lost in translation. And I'm trying to find what the beautiful moments are. I prefer to be able to see people's faces. But there's also other distractions too, Kyle. Phones are going off, things are going off. In a therapy room, we kind of are able to all of that off. But in a virtual space, the stuff of life is still happening around you.\nTherapist Emotion: fear\nTherapeutic Strategy: Communication Skills\nClient: Well, I've shared with MedCircle viewers that I was diagnosed with depression when I was nine years old. I have been diagnosed with depression multiple times since, as I've seen new therapists and new psychiatrists and psychologists. But at this point, I am feeling, and I say that only to say that anxiety never felt like a big issue for me. Certainly there were elements of anxiety, but it was really always more the depression. Until now. I feel like my anxiety is up. And so I like to use. We know this isn't going to be a real therapist or not my therapist. We have a professional and personal relationship. But I feel very comfortable being vulnerable. And I think this will give people a good look into some of the notes that could come up during therapy. So with that in mind, I would love to just kind of have discussion with you about anxiety in this new time.\nClient Emotion: joy\nTherapist: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, it's funny, in my sessions with clients now, we actually have the issues that are happening in the world right now. Pandemic issues, call them isolation issues. And that's the first few minutes of the session. It could have been the whole session. And then we go to real life. Because the fact is, life didn't stop because all of this happened.

Yeah, we're going through this whole thing, but like, I wake up and I go, okay, oh, okay, everything's cool. And then I go down to the kitchen and I go, okay, wait, wait. And then I go, okay.

It has a name, okay? And many, many people, before any of what's happening in the world happened, were living with free floating anxiety all the time. Their friends who are maybe friends and family who are being less than kind. We call them worry, but they worry about everything. And they're saying, you know what? Just anxious. I'm crawling out of my skin. I can't sit still. Free floating anxiety is not an unusual presentation of anxiety. And there's different ways we can meet someone on their free floating anxiety. Now, there's different things that can contribute to free floating anxiety. Some of it is just existing anxiety that people sometimes are anxious kids become anxious adults. So the kids who, when they were six years old would wonder what happens when the sun blows up? What happens when I die? Like, they're those kids who ask those questions. I had a kid who asked those questions, and she's still pretty anxious. You know, they're just. And I was an anxious kid. So I get that. Like, you just. They're just worried kids and they become worried adults and they worry about everything. One thing we do know with free floating anxiety is that a lot of the tools we use for anxiety, things like mindfulness meditation and breathing work really well. And so those would be sort of one of the things we are doing. All of us who are doing, working with clients right now, even Virtually and it's not as satisfying, but we could definitely do it is work on a mindfulness exercise right then and there. Because remember when we have free floating anxiety, it's a combination of worrying and worrying about the future, which are both kind of pointless because the past can't be changed and the future hasn't happened. So we're like, what is happening now? And I, this is a psychologist, is the. I've never seen this. And it's become the best time in history, maybe in at least in contemporary human history to work fullness because nobody. It's the first time we're all sort of like to work on what to work on mindfulness."}

So let me use one of the techniques I'm trying a lot of my clients, which is washing. We're supposed to wash our hands like 30 times now, right? Every time you wash your hands, that's a misintervention. So Kyle, an interesting place we can start with you is let's do something we're all having to do 20 times a day, which is Hand Washington. So you said you're feeling this free floating anxiety. A great place to start for you would be again, this thing you're having to do and it has a lot of sensation involved in it. Right. When you turn on the water and you pay attention to the temperature of the water flow of the water on your hands. I'm telling everyone, if you can use a soap that has a smell you like, that's great because that's one more sense you can be aware of. You put the soap in your hand and you feel whether it's a bar of soap or liquid soap, you feel the sensation of the soap. Then you're moving your hands and you're paying attention to the sensation of moving your hands, the soap between your fingers, the temperature of the water. Ideally you even close your eyes during this and do some breathing or if you keep your eyes open, reflect on the color of the color of the suds and all that. This may seem silly, but it's actually not. Because for that 45 seconds, if you become immersed in Hand Washington, it's almost like a little bit of a reboot, a tiny little reboot that you out of the worry, as it were, the free floating anxiety. And it then becomes a technique that you realize like you can draw upon and there's other ways you can do this. One technique that all of us are talking about it's something you can use a lot is breathing when you have a moment, when that anxiety is hitting you and hitting you hard. Literally that breathing in, holding it, and then a slower exhale. Paying attention to how you feel is also another really useful technique. It's just like a. You can grab when you're feeling that anxiety. And you'd be amazed if you want to even try that now. Like, just eyes open, eyes closed, whatever you prefer. But take a slow inhale, pay attention to how your body's feeling and holding that inhale, and then slowly, ideally through your nose, letting that breath go and feeling this inside of your body, of your shoulders, maybe coming down. Yeah, it does change you. It does change you. And that's something you can use out the day."}

So the kids who, when they were six years old would wonder what happens when the sun blows up? What happens when I die? Like, they're those kids who ask those questions. I had a kid who asked those questions, and she's still pretty anxious. You know, they're just. And I was an anxious kid. So I get that. Like, you just. They're just worried kids and they become worried adults and they worry about everything. One thing we do know with free floating anxiety is that a lot of the tools we use for anxiety, things like mindfulness meditation and breathing work really well. And so those would be sort of one of the things we are doing. All of us who are doing, working with clients right now, even Virtually and it's not as satisfying, but we could definitely do it is work on a mindfulness exercise right then and there. Because remember when we have free floating anxiety, it's a combination of worrying and worrying about the future, which are both kind of pointless because the past can't be changed and the future hasn't happened. So we're like, what is happening now? And I, this is a psychologist, is the. I've never seen this. And it's become the best time in history, maybe in at least in contemporary human history to work fullness because nobody. It's the first time we're all sort of like to work on what to work on mindfulness.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Open questions\nClient: Oh, on mindfulness, yeah.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nTherapist: Because mindfulness really forces us into the present moment and when you're having free flowing anxiety. So let me use one of the techniques I'm trying a lot of my clients, which is washing. We're supposed to wash our hands like 30 times now, right? Every time you wash your hands, that's a misintervention. So Kyle, an interesting place we can start with you is let's do something we're all having to do 20 times a day, which is Hand Washington. So you said you're feeling this free floating anxiety. A great place to start for you would be again, this thing you're having to do and it has a lot of sensation involved in it. Right. When you turn on the water and you pay attention to the temperature of the water flow of the water on your hands. I'm telling everyone, if you can use a soap that has a smell you like, that's great because that's one more sense you can be aware of. You put the soap in your hand and you feel whether it's a bar of soap or liquid soap, you feel the sensation of the soap. Then you're moving your hands and you're paying attention to the sensation of moving your hands, the soap between your fingers, the temperature of the water. Ideally you even close your eyes during this and do some breathing or if you keep your eyes open, reflect on the color of the color of the suds and all that. This may seem silly, but it's actually not. Because for that 45 seconds, if you become immersed in Hand Washington, it's almost like a little bit of a reboot, a tiny little reboot that you out of the worry, as it were, the free floating anxiety. And it then becomes a technique that you realize like you can draw upon and there's other ways you can do this. One technique that all of us are talking about it's something you can use a lot is breathing when you have a moment, when that anxiety is hitting you and hitting you hard. Literally that breathing in, holding it, and then a slower exhale. Paying attention to how you feel is also another really useful technique. It's just like a. You can grab when you're feeling that anxiety. And you'd be amazed if you want to even try that now. Like, just eyes open, eyes closed, whatever you prefer. But take a slow inhale, pay attention to how your body's feeling and holding that inhale, and then slowly, ideally through your nose, letting that breath go and feeling this inside of your body, of your shoulders, maybe coming down. Yeah, it does change you. It does change you. And that's something you can use out the day.\nTherapist Emotion: neutral\nTherapeutic Strategy: Open questions", "input": "Client: So when my anxiety hits me the hardest is at night when I walk into bed and I'm tired.

So I think actually we're going to see in retrospect, many people are actually attempting to log more hours of sleep. People are also bored. There's just nothing to do. At some point, I'm just going to go to sleep. But as with all sleep issues and anxiety and sleep problems are really, really linked. We'd want to do for you is review your whole sleep things, as it were. Like, we might want you to get tired in another room and only move to bed when you're ready to call it quits. Make sense?"}

Okay, okay, okay.\nClient Emotion: neutral\nClient Emotion Analysis: The speaker appears to be in a state of sadness or disappointment. Their posture and facial expression convey a sense of emotional distress. It is possible that the speaker is experiencing a difficult personal situation or has encountered some form of adversity. The emotional cues suggest that the speaker may be struggling to cope with a challenging life event.\nTherapist: But here's the difference, Kyle. You're labeling this as some sort of a fail, that I can't sit with this imagery and advocate for it, that I am not tougher or something like that.

And you've advocated for animal rights your entire career and you will continue to do so. But does that have to happen? Nobody needs to watch or repeated videos of these abusive things to know that they're happening. They're happening regularly, all these realms. And right now for you, I'm hearing from you this idea that people may even be entertained by seeing something that's happening.

So when somebody brings something to your attention, you don't need to witness it, you don't need to watch it. Because that sounds like it is very. It really provokes physiological aspects of anxiety that you. I mean, people who view that imagery from your place, who are upset by. They feel a tightness in their chest, like they can't breathe, their heart races. They sometimes. People almost sometimes feel to the point of panic. There is no reason for you to watch that imagery. If you were saying that you need to watch something that is integral to your job, that is like you need to read something that would allow you. This is not necessary. You can do this advocacy without that. But it's giving yourself the permission to figure out a way in a regular way, whether it's a blog, whether it's a video series you put out, whether it's working with an existing advocacy agency that would play out how you thought was fit, but without Feeling that you need to take it all on, which is very common in anxiety, is that it's an all or nothingness.

That sort of sense of everything's, you know, out of control, and we just sort of. It's like a. It's a feeling. It's a mood state. So work on the thinking, the feeling, and the physiological feeling.

This is running my life. And I say, it's not running your life. Let's figure out a new way to talk about this that I don't. I don't need. This is not something I need to watch. I understand this. There's other ways I can engage in this content. This is. Though they feel like I'm not. I'm not doing right by other sexual assault survivors. It's not, you know, and to let a lot give themselves permission to say, I don't want to watch this doesn't feel comfortable for me. I'm protecting me. Because, again, anyone who's been through trauma, it's about protecting yourself. But it's a lot of what managing anxiety is, is giving yourself permission. And because the flood of emotion is like a tsunami, it's just literally taking you over. It's finding different ways to talk about it, think about it, and get to a place of acceptance.

When we're looking at something like narcissism or narcissistic personality, it's a slow burn. In reality, it could have taken us weeks or even months of sessions for these patterns to come clear. I've worked with clients. It took me six to nine months for me to really see, like, oh, now I know exactly what I'm dealing with. You can get some of the superficial narcissism at A dinner party. But the real depth work to get this, that could take a long time. I know you. I had that advantage. Kyle, I've been working with you for months. So you know, I know enough about you.\nTherapist Emotion: depression\nTherapeutic Strategy: Structuring the therapy\nClient: But, but I could be lying.\nClient Emotion: sadness\nTherapist: You know, you could be lying and anyone could be lying in therapy and you know, you could listen. You're in an industry that celebrates superficial validation seeking stuff and you do like being on this side of the camera. Maybe any of us that want to be on this side of the camera need to take a good hard look inside and say, why is that? Why is it more important for us to be on this side than that side? Because those are absolutely equal roles to me. So there is some self examination that needs to happen there. Over the course of longer term therapy, we look at how do you intersect in your relationships. Maybe this pattern of low emotionality is actually something we, we do need to be more concerned about. And as I got to know more about you and saw how it surfaced with family, with friends, with partners, with coworkers, I might start to see a pattern there that's not just low emotionality. Maybe it would evidence its lack of empathy. So this is something that we would have to continue to kind of pull up. But you certainly didn't come in here kind of arrogant and brash.
